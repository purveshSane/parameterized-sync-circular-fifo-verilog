# Creation and Verification of a Parameterized Synchronous Circular FIFO using SystemVerilog
This is one of my personal projects which will help me practice Verilog and SystemVerilog. It is a synchronous circular "First In, First Out" (FIFO) structure written in Verilog with a provided testbench (tb) around it using OOPs. The design is also parameterizable to provide the ability to change the size of the FIFO, blocksize of the FIFO, and its I/O Data Width.

I designed it using ![this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1-5Jx4Mg-g) as a reference.
